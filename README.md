# juix

This channel is not ready for use. I use it only to learn how to
use personal guix channels.

## Current status

1. Haven't setup channel authentications.

2. I will get back to this in the long run. Currently, for
   personal usage, I should just use the method given
   [here](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Package-Modules.html)
   (or see [this](https://github.com/lfam/pkgs)).
